Background Information: My name is Florenz Ovel Bacting (or “Ovel” for short), I am in RMIT University studying Bachelor of Information Technology as a first-year student. I was born in the Philippines, a country in South-East Asia in 2003. I was educated upto Year 3 until my parents decided to move to Melbourne, Australia in 2012, I have been living and studying here ever since. I was once fluent in speaking my home language (Tagalog), however as the years passed I have slowly forgotten but I can still understand most phrases. 

I am very interested in three aspects (Computers, world history and entrepreneurship), which take up most of my spare time, playing video games, researching about the history of the digital world, watching documentaries about historical events as well as how businesses started and what led to their success (most notably the Gymshark founders). Eventually in the future, I wish to take in my knowledge in IT as well as entrepreneurship to start a clothing industry business, starting with dropshipping then slowly transitioning into a production and retail business.

A (not so fun) fact about me is that I have made $4,000 in profit trading “Dogecoin” which is classified as a memecoin, a cryptocurrency that has no discernable purpose.
