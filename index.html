    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
   
    <p>
      My name is Florenz Ovel Bacting (or “Ovel” for short), I am in RMIT University 
      studying Bachelor of Information Technology as a first-year student. I was born in the Philippines, a country in South-East Asia in 2003. 
      I was educated upto Year 3 until my parents decided to move to Melbourne, Australia in 2012, I have been living and studying here ever since. 
      I was once fluent in speaking my home language (Tagalog), however as the years passed I have slowly forgotten but I can still understand most phrases.</p>
    
    <p>
      I am very interested in three aspects (Computers, world history and entrepreneurship), which take up most of my spare time, playing video games, 
      researching about the history of the digital world, watching documentaries about historical events as well as how businesses started and 
      what led to their success (most notably the Gymshark founders). Eventually in the future, I wish to take in my knowledge in IT as well as 
      entrepreneurship to start a clothing industry business, starting with dropshipping then slowly transitioning into a production and retail business.</p>
    
    <p>
      A (not so fun) fact about me is that I have made $4,000 in profit trading “Dogecoin” which is classified as a memecoin, 
      a cryptocurrency that has no discernable purpose.</p>
    
    <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
    
    <p>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? 
      At a very young age, I immediately became very fascinated in how various technologies work, 
      how they were made, how to operate them and how it directly affects the world we live in right now. Moreover, I started avidly playing video games when I got my very first console (Playstation 3) in the late 2000s, 
      with popular titles such as “Assassin's Creed” and “Call of Duty”. Along with having been exposed to a personal computer (PC) at an early age of 5, I was hooked with technology. 
      To me, it became a place where you could be anyone and basically have freedom at your fingertips. As I progressed through my primary and secondary studies, 
      that passion for technology has done nothing but pique my interest, I learned the behind the scenes in programs, how certain coding works to improve the functionality of the application. 
      Overtime, I also undertook Business Studies in High School, where I learned how businesses implement various technologies to stay competitive against other industry “big dogs” in the ever changing digital world. 
      Eventually, I specifically found what I wanted to study and do in the future. Combining my passion for how businesses work and how information technology can help businesses all over the world, 
      I decided to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in IT, hoping to improve a business's operations through digital technology with my future career.</p>
    
    <p>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
      While there have been several experiences that helped me shape my interest in IT. A notable event was a casual conversation back in 2015 with a family friend, Raphael, who works for SAP Ariba, 
      a software solution that enables suppliers and buyers to connect and communicate through a single platform, improving vendor management by introducing price-saving ways of procurement and simplifying business dealings. 
      His job within the organisation was to ensure a healthy communication between the business and consulting team, as well as market their product to customers all around the globe. 
      Immediately then, I decided that I was going to do something similar to the likes of that.</p>

    <p>Aftershock PC Australia - Worked in a coordinated retail store environment over a one-week placement period. Worked full-time hours and assisted as a member of hardware repair and customer service. 
      Throughout this period, I acquired an understanding of the hardware aspect of computers through building gaming systems and learning the different parts that make up a computer 
      (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.) and how they work together to run the system.</p>
    
    <p>GraceWest Bible Church - Volunteered to be a multimedia operator for a local church. Tasks include putting up lyrics on the overhead screen, managing recordings and editing/creating PowerPoint slides. 
      Operating video streaming systems such as BlackMagic Design (ATEM)</p>
    
    <p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
      Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (or RMIT) is a global top 250 university, widely recognised as a good institute for tertiary education. Moreover, in terms of computer science and information systems, 
      it is ranked 98th globally for Best Global World University Rankings 2021. Immediately, I knew that this was the right university for me, as I was pursuing a course around a mix of business studies and information technology. 
      Other than the quality of education in RMIT, the university is also known for having a good reputation for being very professional and known for having a more “hands on” experience instead of mainly theory work like other universities, 
      which perfectly suits my learning style.</p>

    <p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?
      Throughout my time at RMIT, I expect to learn and perhaps master a variety of coding languages, as well as factors that make good programmers “stand out” from ordinary programmers. 
      Moreover, as a result of numerous group projects that will occur in the foreseeable future, I aspire to build on my communication and interpersonal skills, as well as the ability to work efficiently in a team, 
      which will significantly assist me in my future career as a programmer.</p>
