    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
   
    <p>
      My name is Florenz Ovel Bacting (or “Ovel” for short), I am in RMIT University 
      studying Bachelor of Information Technology as a first-year student. I was born in the Philippines, a country in South-East Asia in 2003. 
      I was educated upto Year 3 until my parents decided to move to Melbourne, Australia in 2012, I have been living and studying here ever since. 
      I was once fluent in speaking my home language (Tagalog), however as the years passed I have slowly forgotten but I can still understand most phrases.</p>
    
    <p>
      I am very interested in three aspects (Computers, world history and entrepreneurship), which take up most of my spare time, playing video games, 
      researching about the history of the digital world, watching documentaries about historical events as well as how businesses started and 
      what led to their success (most notably the Gymshark founders). Eventually in the future, I wish to take in my knowledge in IT as well as 
      entrepreneurship to start a clothing industry business, starting with dropshipping then slowly transitioning into a production and retail business.</p>
    
    <p>
      A (not so fun) fact about me is that I have made $4,000 in profit trading “Dogecoin” which is classified as a memecoin, 
      a cryptocurrency that has no discernable purpose.</p>
    
    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    
    
    <h4>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h4>
      <p>At a very young age, I immediately became very fascinated in how various technologies work, 
      how they were made, how to operate them and how it directly affects the world we live in right now. Moreover, I started avidly playing video games when I got my very first console (Playstation 3) in the late 2000s, 
      with popular titles such as “Assassin's Creed” and “Call of Duty”. Along with having been exposed to a personal computer (PC) at an early age of 5, I was hooked with technology. 
      To me, it became a place where you could be anyone and basically have freedom at your fingertips. As I progressed through my primary and secondary studies, 
      that passion for technology has done nothing but pique my interest, I learned the behind the scenes in programs, how certain coding works to improve the functionality of the application. 
      Overtime, I also undertook Business Studies in High School, where I learned how businesses implement various technologies to stay competitive against other industry “big dogs” in the ever changing digital world. 
      Eventually, I specifically found what I wanted to study and do in the future. Combining my passion for how businesses work and how information technology can help businesses all over the world, 
      I decided to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in IT, hoping to improve a business's operations through digital technology with my future career.</p>
    
     <h4>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h4>
      <p>While there have been several experiences that helped me shape my interest in IT. A notable event was a casual conversation back in 2015 with a family friend, Raphael, who works for SAP Ariba, 
      a software solution that enables suppliers and buyers to connect and communicate through a single platform, improving vendor management by introducing price-saving ways of procurement and simplifying business dealings. 
      His job within the organisation was to ensure a healthy communication between the business and consulting team, as well as market their product to customers all around the globe. 
      Immediately then, I decided that I was going to do something similar to the likes of that.</p>

    <p>Aftershock PC Australia - Worked in a coordinated retail store environment over a one-week placement period. Worked full-time hours and assisted as a member of hardware repair and customer service. 
      Throughout this period, I acquired an understanding of the hardware aspect of computers through building gaming systems and learning the different parts that make up a computer 
      (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.) and how they work together to run the system.</p>
    
    <p>GraceWest Bible Church - Volunteered to be a multimedia operator for a local church. Tasks include putting up lyrics on the overhead screen, managing recordings and editing/creating PowerPoint slides. 
      Operating video streaming systems such as BlackMagic Design (ATEM)</p>
    
    <h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
      <p>Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (or RMIT) is a global top 250 university, widely recognised as a good institute for tertiary education. Moreover, in terms of computer science and information systems, 
      it is ranked 98th globally for Best Global World University Rankings 2021. Immediately, I knew that this was the right university for me, as I was pursuing a course around a mix of business studies and information technology. 
      Other than the quality of education in RMIT, the university is also known for having a good reputation for being very professional and known for having a more “hands on” experience instead of mainly theory work like other universities, 
      which perfectly suits my learning style.</p>

    <h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
      <p>Throughout my time at RMIT, I expect to learn and perhaps master a variety of coding languages, as well as factors that make good programmers “stand out” from ordinary programmers. 
      Moreover, as a result of numerous group projects that will occur in the foreseeable future, I aspire to build on my communication and interpersonal skills, as well as the ability to work efficiently in a team, 
      which will significantly assist me in my future career as a programmer.</p>
    
    <h3>My Ideal Job</h3>
      
    <p>Direct URL: https://careers.activision.com/job/R009009/Associate-Software-Engineer-Gameplay</p>     
    <p>Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/4OUdcad</p>
      
    <h4>Associate Gameplay Engineer:
        (Activision/High Moon Studios)</h4>
      
    <p>“High Moon Studios is an award-winning studio developing for the Call of Duty® franchise, with past development on over 15 titles including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, 
        Bungie’s Destiny 2: Forsaken, and Transformers: Fall of Cybertron. We employ more than 100 people in Carlsbad, CA, a seaside city in San Diego County.”</p>

    <p>This position works closely with content teams to push gameplay experiences to new levels of fun and visual fidelity. 
        Tasks include creating new systems and improving existing ones to improve player experience through immersive gameplay.</p>
      
    <p>Tasks include: working together with designers/animators in relation to improving gameplay, optimising work (such as performance and bandwidth improvements) and fixing known bugs to improve player experience

    <p>This position really grabs my interest because I was exposed to video games at a very young age (especially the Call of Duty franchise), so I figured it would be wonderful to work for the company that has basically made my childhood. 
      Moreover, I can also further understand what comes into making these video games, the technicality behind it, and how each aspect of the development team is crucial in making a fun gameplay experience.</p>

    <h4>Skills/experience needed:</h4>
    <p>Excellent C++ programing skills</p> 
    <p>Fluency in 3D mathematics, related to game programming</p> 
    <p>Strong design sensibilities and outstanding communication skills</p> 
    <p> A strong passion for video games</p> 
    <p>1+ years of experience in games</p>

    <p>Overall, the most important aspect needed for this position is a degree of mastery in the C++ coding language. Nowadays, most video games are developed with C++ because it allows the programmer to work directly with the DirectX software, 
      “a series of application programming interfaces (API) that provide low-level access to hardware components like video cards, the sound card, and memory.” Furthermore, I am assuming applicants who want to be considered must have a high level of 
      interpersonal skills, problem solving skills and great teamwork, in order to successfully communicate with their colleagues with regards to the project at hand.</p>
    
    <h4>Bonus points:</h4>
    <p>Modern animation techniques and blend trees</p> 
    <p>Networked game logic</p>
    <p>Real-world AI methods</p>
    <p>Extending an established code base</p>

    <h4>Current skills/experience:</h4>
      <p>Aftershock PC Australia, an award-winning PC builder business which opened in Australia in 2018, they offer a range of personal computers and laptops ranging from budget systems to high-spec machines. 
      During Year 10, I undertook a one-week work placement in their West Melbourne branch, working in a coordinated retail store environment with full-time hours and assisted as a member of repair and customer service. 
      Throughout this period, I acquired an understanding of the hardware aspect of computers through building gaming systems and learning the different parts that make up a computer (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.) and how they work together to run the system.  
      Moreover, throughout this time I worked with several other employees in a team-based environment, constantly solving problems that arise and maximising efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace. 
      This placement greatly improved with how I present myself in a group, and how to take roles and responsibilities with good initiative.</p>

    <p>Excellent understanding of video games, having been exposed to computers at a young age, there was no doubt that I would find my way into the vast world of gaming. With over a decade of experience with different games (especially first-person-shooters) 
      I can confidently say that I would be a great fit in the working environment of High Moon Studios, knowing I will be on the same page as other employees in project work.</p>
    

    <h4>Personal plan:</h4>
      <p>The job position indicates that “excellent C++ skills” is needed, I have never tried the C++ programming language before, only trying other more basic languages such as Python (which I am learning now) Both languages are vastly different, 
      C++ is a static-type language and Python is a dynamic-type language. Declaring variables vary in both of them. Moreover, C++ has a lot of features and a very difficult syntax compared to Python. 
      Proper use of the C++ means that I need to know specific parts of the language to use in different situations, as well as understanding what a process will do to execute the code that I write.</p>
    
    <p>Nonetheless, I am eager to start my C++ journey through Codecademy, an online interactive platform that offers coding classes with a variety of languages. I will use this to gain a basic understanding of C++. 
      As I further my knowledge, coding bootcamps can also be another option, enabling me to focus on important aspects of coding and undertaking challenges.</p>
    
    <p>Ultimately however, the key to mastering the language is constantly exposing yourself to work on applying my skills into real-world problems. Therefore, I will aspire to practice at least a few hours a week to hone my understanding about the language.</p>
    
    <h2>Personality Profile</h2>
    <h3>Test 1: Myers-Briggs Personality Test (Logician, INTP-T)</h3>
    
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>According to the 16 personalities website, logicians are always thinking and often “lose themselves in thought”, ever constantly wondering about the mysteries of life. As a result, world-renowned philosophers such as René Descartes and 
      Blaise Pascal have been logicians. Furthermore, some of the most influential scientists are also considered logicians, notably the likes of Albert Einstein and Charles Darwin.</p>
    
    <h4>Strenghts:</h4>
    <p>Analytical: needing to analyse everything</p>
    <p>Original: often comes up with innovative ideas</p>
    <p>Open-minded/Curious: receptive to ideas that have reason</p>
    <p>Objective: opposed to bias and misinformation</p>
    
    <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
    <p>Disconnected: lost in own train of thought</p>
    <p>Insensitive: believes that being logic-focused, and pragmatic is the best way to make decisions</p>
    <p>Dissatisfied: trying to fix things that aren’t broken</p>
    <p>Impatient: wants results fast</p>
    <p>Perfectionist: always striving for flawlessness and perfection, can affect decision-making</p>
    
    <h4>Critique and Validity of test:</h4>
    <p>As a logician, working in teams may not look like an easy feat, however “they often do their best work in collaboration with other people.” Taking in strengths such as having the ability to look at things in a very analytical way 
      can help improve both myself and the group as a whole. In addition, the capability of being open-minded can also assist in brainstorming innovative ideas that can greatly support the outcome of the project in question.</p>
    <p>However, on the other hand, weaknesses such as being very logic minded can also negatively affect the working environment, like group morale and chemistry. In response, I have to put myself into a healthy “limbo” between being rational and emotional in order to get the best results possible. 
      Overall, I strongly believe that the results that have been gathered from the test are mostly accurate, I accept that I am a logician. A person that is highly introverted, yet an analytical observer who may seem disconnected from reality as a result of 
      being so deep in thought about random things, exploring concepts and learning how the world works.</p>
    
    <h3>Test 2: Honey and Mumford Learning Styles (Reflector)</h3>
    
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>One of Honey and Mumford’s learning styles is the reflector. They often learn through critical observation. Very thoughtful and passive when it comes to general discussions, 
      considering all points made before offering one’s own views. Moreover, reflectors do not quickly jump to conclusions, preferring to gather various perspectives and sources before committing to any action.</p>
    
    <h4>Critique and Validity of test:</h4>
    <p>In my opinion, I believe that I am indeed a reflector, as I learn something best by first observing others do it in the right manner and consequently trying it myself. Therefore, I can convert the various advantages of being a reflector into great teamwork in a group project. 
      Using strengths such as observing the playing field before jumping in, I can confidently come up with ideas that can work in favour of the project at hand and disregard other ideas that may not be so great.</p>
    
    <h3>Test 3: Extraversion/Intraversion Test</h3>
    <p>According to the results I am sort of in the middle of being an extrovert and introvert. Mutually enjoy being with large and small groups of people. In essence, I have built a balance “between actively involving myself in a large social network, 
      and spending some quality time with a few intimate friends.” While having a social life is somewhat important to my life, ultimately it is not the most crucial thing. In terms of the consequence of this in teamwork, 
      I strongly believe that it is advantageous, because while I may not always be the conversation-starter, it does not mean that I cannot be outgoing, 
      still having the ability to effectively collaborate when needed and contribute appreciable ideas with the group.</p>
