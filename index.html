    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    
    <p>Background Information: 
      My name is Florenz Ovel Bacting (or “Ovel” for short), I am in RMIT University 
      studying Bachelor of Information Technology as a first-year student. I was born in the Philippines, a country in South-East Asia in 2003. 
      I was educated upto Year 3 until my parents decided to move to Melbourne, Australia in 2012, I have been living and studying here ever since. 
      I was once fluent in speaking my home language (Tagalog), however as the years passed I have slowly forgotten but I can still understand most phrases.</p>
    <p>I am very interested in three aspects (Computers, world history and entrepreneurship), which take up most of my spare time, playing video games, 
      researching about the history of the digital world, watching documentaries about historical events as well as how businesses started and 
      what led to their success (most notably the Gymshark founders). Eventually in the future, I wish to take in my knowledge in IT as well as 
      entrepreneurship to start a clothing industry business, starting with dropshipping then slowly transitioning into a production and retail business.</p>
    <p>A (not so fun) fact about me is that I have made $4,000 in profit trading “Dogecoin” which is classified as a memecoin, 
      a cryptocurrency that has no discernable purpose.</p>
    
    <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
    <p>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? 
      At a very young age, I immediately became very fascinated in how various technologies work, 
      how they were made, how to operate them and how it directly affects the world we live in right now. Moreover, I started avidly playing video games when I got my very first console (Playstation 3) in the late 2000s, 
      with popular titles such as “Assassin's Creed” and “Call of Duty”. Along with having been exposed to a personal computer (PC) at an early age of 5, I was hooked with technology. 
      To me, it became a place where you could be anyone and basically have freedom at your fingertips. As I progressed through my primary and secondary studies, 
      that passion for technology has done nothing but pique my interest, I learned the behind the scenes in programs, how certain coding works to improve the functionality of the application. 
      Overtime, I also undertook Business Studies in High School, where I learned how businesses implement various technologies to stay competitive against other industry “big dogs” in the ever changing digital world. 
      Eventually, I specifically found what I wanted to study and do in the future. Combining my passion for how businesses work and how information technology can help businesses all over the world, 
      I decided to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in IT, hoping to improve a business's operations through digital technology with my future career.</p>
